<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">My name is
Travis Malmquist. I am an undergrad computer science senior at the
University of Memphis, pursuing a bachelor's degree. As of right now,
I have studied different languages such as: Java, C/C++, Ruby, and
Python. I know some knowledge of C# but very little. My main choice
of programming is C++. With it, I am learning how to code graphics
from scratch. To me, I see the views, screens, pages, or any other
word, of a software as just a bunch of pictures and graphics
manipulations. If I can manipulate graphics and pictures, then I
prolly will be able to create any software that's out there. In one
of my courses, I learned that, as a computer science programmer, I
need to keep in mind that sometimes the need to delve upon my
instincts or heart or feelings is a necessity as well as delving upon
my mind or logic. One simply can't be ignored more than the other. In
computer security, I gained knowledge of security in software as well
as for physical objects like buildings. One principle I learned in
computer security is the principle of separation of duties. That one
is self explanatory. Now, I know I may not sound computer science
geeky, but trust me, I'm not. I'm more of a designer, graphics, or
artistic feeler. The truth is I started as a kid who liked stories.
From there, I wanted to create stories. So from lots and lots of
listening to the epic music genre, brainstorming, and imagination, I
came up with my first short story series. It failed cause it was too
repetitive. The next one after that failed cause it resembled to
closely of a franchise. Now, I am happy to say that I have written
fifteen short stories in the same universe. In terms of computer
science, this isn't very techy.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">However, the
answer came clear to me that I wanted to become a video game
designer. I would make my stories into video games and share them to
all the children around the world. And as I progressed in at least a
year into computer science, I learned that I will enjoy making games
from nothing but scratch and pure C++. Cause, you know, C++ is what
all games these days are written in. As of right now, I learned how
to move objects across a windows screen using Winmain in visual
studio C++. From there, I learned that not only will I be able to
create video games, but other software as well. In my young years, I
learned that perhaps thinking analytically wasn't the only to use
analysis. So it occurred to me that perhaps we can feel analytically
as well. People told me that I am different, that I think
differently. I am the second oldest of six children with parents who
loved spoiling us when we were little. However, the downsides to all
that is that we had to deal with a lot of mental illness issues from
my parents' exes. From that experience, I learned that the best gift
in life is a hug or advice. As a teenager, I was largely a quiet
loner. However now, I am a semi-loner. I have a cousin who loves me
very much and I am very grateful for having him in my life. I am
honestly, a gryffindor. I am not so quiet nowadays. Something that
most writers don't do is that I listen to epic music genre. Which
intensifies my imagination and analytical feeling or thinking. Which
reminds me... here's a conversation I had with someone, this is an
example of my logic and analytical thinking skills:</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Me: Hey what
would you call someone who actively searches for people who hurt
others and gives them justice? Like Batman. Except doesn't wear
something to hide his or hers identity. Someone who actively loves to
expose serial killers for who they are</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Me: Thanks! I
thought vigilante meant that you do something above the law. That you
take the law into your own hands. Not about targeting perpetrators. I
was thinking of someone who doesn't take the law into his own hands
but exposes perpetrators for who they are for fun. And lets the
courts decide justice. Someone who uses love instead of fear to
expose them.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif">Me: Maybe. Let's
make one up: so the root word &ldquo;path&rdquo; means feeling or
disease. Like empath or pyschopath. We just need to figure the
prefix.</FONT></FONT></P>

Veritas means truth. Keyword: Ver-. Ostend is the keyword for

ostend-. Take off the d gives osten. Verostenopath. We don't need the
