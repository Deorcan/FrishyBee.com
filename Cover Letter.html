<P>Dear hiring manager,</P>
<P style="margin-left: 2vw; margin-right: 12vw; text-indent: 0.47in;">
My name is Travis Malmquist. I am a recent graduate from The
University of Memphis, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
As of right now, I have studied different languages such as: Java, C/C++, Javascript,
and Python. My main choice of programming is web browser developing. With these skills,
I have learned how to make a basic website (as you can probably already seen). 
I have also been working on responsive web page making, however, I'm still a bit new to that concept. 
I've also created my first browser video game as a test for my computer skills. Back when I was in grade school, 
I've starting creating 2D models using OpenOffice drawing. Right now, I'm able to create 3Dish models however, 
they're not necessarily 3D yet. I've also practiced on creating short stories and I still write as a hobby. 
Now, I know I may not sound computer science geeky, but trust me, I'm not. I'm more of a designer, graphics, 
or artistic feeler. I also love teaching. In terms of computer science, this isn't very techy.</P>
<P style="margin-left: 2vw; margin-right: 12vw; text-indent: 0.47in;">
In terms of my experience, I have three years worth as a desk assistance at The University of Memphis. 
I worked primarily in the dormitories. There, I'd swipe residential cards and made sure people lived there. 
I also was somewhat a security guard because I'd have to the cameras open on my computer that I'd be able to glance 
at whenever I'm not swiping or being the help desk. Sometimes people would sneak in and so it can take a lot of awareness and 
focus to keep at the job, especially if I'm sleepy. We'd also report lock outs or people who'd be locked out of their room. 
Due to the pandemic and graduating, I couldn't keep this job. So, during the summer I've spent my time at web page developing, 
modeling, and writing. I've also been working on a website for one of my parents. Who hopefully could reach out to her colleagues 
and perhaps I could become a web developing freelancer. I could also work for a company as well.</P>
<P style="margin-left: 2vw; margin-right: 12vw; text-indent: 0.47in;">
Anyway, thank you for your consideration on reading this letter. I prefer to be contacted by email, 
however if you do call me, please leave a voicemail if I don't pick up. I would like to follow up on this in a week from now.
</P>

Yours Truly,<br>Travis Malmquist
