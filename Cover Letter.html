	<P>Dear hiring manager,</P>
	<P style="margin-left: 2vw; margin-right: 12vw; text-indent: 0.47in;">My name is
Travis Malmquist. I am a recent graduate from The
University of Memphis, with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.
As of right now, I have studied different languages such as: Java, C/C++,
Ruby, and Python. I know some knowledge of C# but very little. My main
choice of programming is C++ and Python. With it, I am learning how to
code graphics from scratch. To me, I see the views, screens, pages, or 
any other word, of a software as just a bunch of pictures and graphics
manipulations. If I can manipulate graphics and pictures, then I
prolly will be able to create any software that's out there. In one
of my courses, I learned that, as a computer science programmer, I
need to keep in mind that sometimes the need to delve upon my
instincts or heart or feelings is a necessity as well as delving upon
my mind or logic. One simply can't be ignored more than the other. In
computer security, I gained knowledge of security in software as well
as for physical objects like buildings. One principle I learned in
computer security is the principle of separation of duties. That one
is self explanatory. Now, I know I may not sound computer science
geeky, but trust me, I'm not. I'm more of a designer, graphics, or
artistic feeler. I also love teaching. The truth is I started as a kid who
liked stories. From there, I wanted to create stories and I wanted to use them
to teach others. So from lots and lots of listening to the epic music genre,
brainstorming, and imagination, I came up with my first short story series.
It failed cause it was too repetitive. The next one after that failed cause it
resembled to closely of a franchise. Now, I am happy to say that I have written
fifteen short stories in the same universe. In terms of computer
science, this isn't very techy.</P>

However, the answer came clear to me that I wanted to become a video game
designer or graphic designer or UI/UX designer. I also could take the road
to being an educator that uses video games as a form of teaching. I would make
my stories into video games, if that was my career choice, and share them to all the
children around the world. And as I progressed in at least two years into computer science,
I learned that I will enjoy making games and other software from nothing but scratch and 
pure C++. Cause, you know, C++ is what all games these days are written in.
As of right now, I learned how to move objects across a windows screen using Winmain in visual
studio C++. And I am coming up with ideas of integrating education into video games.
Thank you for your consideration on reading this letter. If you do not consider me
for the job, the least I will like to ask is what will feedback or advice will you give to me to
do better next time?
