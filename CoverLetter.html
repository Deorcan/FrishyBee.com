<P>Dear hiring manager,<br></P>
</div>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
I am applying for the Retail Associate position in Boss Babe Los Angeles. Confident in my mindset and personality that
I am a candidate for this position, I would consider myself highly intelligent or have an eye in the areas of beauty and taste. I have read
the job description and am willing to be interviewed so you may see me as fit for the task provided for the job.</P>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
In terms of my experience, I have three years worth as a desk assistance at The University of Memphis. 
I worked primarily in the dormitories. There, I gained valuable security awareness such as making sure no one sneaks in
when it's crowded or monitoring the cameras. Due to the pandemic and graduation, I couldn't keep this job. During the pandemic,
I spent my days working on my tech skills. I also developed interests in beauty, fashion, and shopping. I went away
for a summer to visit my grandmother in New York. There, I helped volunteer at the senior apartments building. Now I have
returned to seek out my first post-pandemic job.</P>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
A key difference that would set me apart from other candidates is that I am
a neurodivergent person. I think differently and thrive in creativity when it comes to art, fashion, beauty or aesthetics.
I'm also highly sensitive to my surroundings and other people,
meaning that I process sensory input at a deeper level. This means that I am more interested in the wellbeing of the
customer than anything else, which potentially booms business.</p>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
Following the review of my resume, I am confident that I will be considered for an interview
at Boss Babe Los Angeles. It would also be an honor to work in a place with my interests for a first post-pandemic job. Please contact me at (513) 229-6212 or by email,
siriustravis@gmail.com if you need further information.
