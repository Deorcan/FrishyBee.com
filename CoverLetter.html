<P>Dear hiring manager,</P>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
I am applying for the Retail Associate position in Bath&Body Works. Confident in my mindset and personality that
I am a candidate for this position, I would consider myself highly intelligent or an eye in the areas of beauty and taste. I have read
the job description and am willing to be interviewed so you may see me as fit for the task provided for the job.</P>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
In terms of my experience, I have three years worth as a desk assistance at The University of Memphis. 
I worked primarily in the dormitories. Due to the pandemic and graduation, I couldn't keep this job. During the pandemic,
I spent my days working on my tech skills. I also developed interests in beauty, fashion, and shopping. I went away
for a summer to visit my grandmother in New York. There, I helped volunteer at the senior apartments building. Now I have
returned to seek out my first post-pandemic job.</P>
<P id = "para" style="margin-left: 2vw; text-indent: 0.5in;">
For my name, I currently go by Jac from family and friends. I am planning to change my legal name to Jac when I have
the financial ability to do so. Following the review of my resume, I am confident that I will be considered to be interviewed
at Bath&Body Works.
</P>
